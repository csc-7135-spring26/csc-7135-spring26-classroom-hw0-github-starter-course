## What I learned?
I have learned the basic commands of Git, particularly how to manage **repo**, track version, handling different branches, pull request etc.


## What I am confused about
Not particulary any specific thing, but sometimes I find the merging thing more hectic.

The only life saver yet dangerous command I personally feel is

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hsh>
