I learn Git and GitHub is a porject working station that we can use to track, sharing, and collaborating with your teams.

Also, learn the important terms of GitHub that help me familiarize how to use it. 
- Repositories is the dashboard that helps to navigate and see useful infomation about the project.
- Use branches when you don't want to merge the code for final use. 
- Then, pull requests to ask the other teammate for feedback about the code you write.
- Issues is use when the project has bugs that need to be fixed, and let the other know about any issues you have while working on the project.

The part that I'm confused about is how I get the backup code if someone or me merg the code by accident. How do I get back to the code before merg?
