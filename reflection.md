# GitHub Basics Homework Reflection
## What I learned
- **Repositories**: what they contain (code + issues + docs + history).
- **Commits**: snapshots of changes with messages that explain *why*.
- **Branches**: a safe place to work without breaking `main`.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**: a way to propose changes and get review.
- **Merge**: combining the branch into the main branch after approval.

## What I’m still confused about 
1. What’s the best way to handle **merge conflicts**?
2. When do I use **fork** vs **branch**?
